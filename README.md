# Experiments & Snippets

This repository contains 
- small-scale experiments,
- code snippets, and
- experimental work

The focus of this repository is learning through implementation, and is by no means polished, production-ready projects.
created while learning and practicing concepts of software engineering and development

## Languages & Tools

This repository may include experiments using:
- Python
- PyTorch
- Java
- C / C++
- Assembly
- NumPy, Pandas
- scikit-learn
- OpenCV
- Jupyter Notebooks

## Purpose

This repository exists to:
- Practice programming and computer science concepts
- Explore new languages, tools, and frameworks
- Implement ideas from coursework, tutorials, and personal study
- Test hypotheses quickly before scaling them into full projects


This repository complements my larger projects by showing how I learn, reason, and experiment across multiple layers of the stack.

For fully scoped projects, see my dedicated repositories.


## Structure

The structure evolves over time, but typically follows patterns such as:
